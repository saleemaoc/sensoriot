rekognition should return the best match in that case

also, if its recognized a person and they are shown in the panel below, it doesnt need to alert if it sees them again, once is enough

is the purple circle a counter for how often they have been recognized? that's not needed as it only needs to see them once and alert me, after that just leave them in the list

new recognitions should go above the existing ones

so if it spots 3 different people in a row, the most recent one would be at the top of that list

can we scroll through the list but keep the video in place?

video could even be a bit smaller, the main feature here is the recognized people

i dont mind if video is cropped, i just need a rough idea of where it is pointing so i can make sure its positioned to capture faces correctly

if i click one of the notifications (top of my screen) it seems to reset the app, closes the video and loses the list

clicking the face entry at the bottom opens the linkedin, but when i return to the app the video has closed, any way you can (easily) keep that running? or at least restore it when i return to the app?

can you also stop the phone going into lock mode while recording?

mm last one, the notifications are working but they are not showing on my galaxy watch. i have allowed this app to send notifications to the watch, not sure if an extra step is needed for that, i had hoped that regular notifications would just work

worth noting that galaxy watch is tizen not android, but its connected to my android phone

app crashed :) i was switching a lot and at some point i pressed the camera and it died

oh one more thing, it's having trouble with utf8 emojis i think, see this guy's title
